              <p>40 And again, my beloved brethren, I would speak unto you concerning hope. How is it that ye can attain
                unto faith, save ye shall have hope?</p>

              <p>41 And what is it that ye shall hope for? Behold I say unto you that ye shall have hope through the
                atonement of Christ and the power of his resurrection, to be raised unto life eternal, and this because
                of your faith in him according to the promise.</p>

              <p>42 Wherefore, if a man have faith he must needs have hope; for without faith there cannot be any hope.
              </p>

              <p>43 And again, behold I say unto you that he cannot have faith and hope, save he shall be meek, and
                lowly of heart.</p>

              <p>44 If so, his faith and hope is vain, for none is acceptable before God, save the meek and lowly in
                heart; and if a man be meek and lowly in heart, and confesses by the power of the Holy Ghost that Jesus
                is the Christ, he must needs have charity; for if he have not charity he is nothing; wherefore he must
                needs have charity.</p>

              <p>45 And charity suffereth long, and is kind, and envieth not, and is not puffed up, seeketh not her own,
                is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil, and rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth,
                beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.</p>

              <p>46 Wherefore, my beloved brethren, if ye have not charity, ye are nothing, for charity never faileth.
                Wherefore, cleave unto charity, which is the greatest of all, for all things must fail—</p>

              <p>47 But charity is the pure love of Christ, and it endureth forever; and whoso is found possessed of it
                at the last day, it shall be well with him.</p>

              <p>48 Wherefore, my beloved brethren, pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that ye may be
                filled with this love, which he hath bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son, Jesus Christ;
                that ye may become the sons of God; that when he shall appear we shall be like him, for we shall see him
                as he is; that we may have this hope; that we may be purified even as he is pure. Amen.</p>

              <p>10 For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his
                name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister.</p>

              <p>11 And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto
                the end:</p>

              <p>12 That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.
              </p>

              <p>13 For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself,</p>

              <p>14 Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.</p>

              <p>15 And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.</p>

              <p>16 For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife.
              </p>

              <p>17 Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his
                counsel, confirmed it by an oath:</p>

              <p>18 That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong
                consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us:</p>

              <p>19 Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, and which entereth into that
                within the veil;</p>

              <p>20 Whither the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order

          experience in detail. How did you feel? Why was that experience memorable for

          those
          experiences in your life.</p>
