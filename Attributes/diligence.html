      <h3>What are your experiences with diligence?</h3>
      <div class="instructions-border">
        <p class="instructions">Reflect on experiences in your life when you witnessed a good example of diligence. This
          could
          be
          an example of diligence that you or someone else have done; it's whatever you want. Describe that
          experience in detail. How did you feel? Why was that experience memorable for
          you? As you reflect on this experience, consider how your life would be happier if you created more of those
          experiences in your life.</p>

          actually practicing it. After watching the following videos, think of how an act of diligence could help
          someone else, make a plan, and then do it!</p>
