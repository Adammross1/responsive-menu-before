              <p>Chapter 13</p>

              <p><em>Paul discusses the high status of charity—Charity, a pure love, excels and exceeds almost all
                  else.</em></p>

              <p>1 Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as
                sounding
                brass, or a tinkling cymbal.</p>

              <p>2 And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and
                though
                I
                have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.</p>

              <p>3 And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and
                have
                not charity, it profiteth me nothing.</p>

              <p>4 Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not
                puffed
                up,</p>

              <p>5 Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil;
              </p>

              <p>6 Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;</p>

              <p>7 Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.</p>

              <p>8 Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be
                tongues,
                they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.</p>

              <p>9 For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.</p>

              <p>10 But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.</p>

              <p>11 When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when
                I
                became a man, I put away childish things.</p>

              <p>12 For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then
                shall
                I
                know even as also I am known.</p>

              <p>13 And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.</p>

                it
                at the last day, it shall be well with him.</p>

              <p>48 Wherefore, my beloved brethren, pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that ye may
                be
                filled with this love, which he hath bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son, Jesus
