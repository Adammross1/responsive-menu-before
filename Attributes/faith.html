              <p>Faith is to hope for things which are not seen, but which are true (Heb. 11:1; Alma 32:21), and must be
                centered in Jesus Christ in order to produce salvation. To have faith is to have confidence in something
                or someone. The Lord has revealed Himself and His perfect character, possessing in their fulness all the
                attributes of love, knowledge, justice, mercy, unchangeableness, power, and every other needful thing,
                so as to enable the mind of man to place confidence in Him without reservation. Faith is kindled by
                hearing the testimony of those who have faith (Rom. 10:14–17). Miracles do not produce faith, but strong
                faith is developed by obedience to the gospel of Jesus Christ; in other words, faith comes by
                righteousness, although miracles often confirm one’s faith.</p>

              <p>Faith is a principle of action and of power, and by it one can command the elements, heal the sick, and
                influence any number of circumstances when occasion warrants (Jacob 4:4–7). Even more important, by
                faith one obtains a remission of sins and eventually can stand in the presence of God.</p>

              <p>All true faith must be based upon correct knowledge or it cannot produce the desired results. Faith in
                Jesus Christ is the first principle of the gospel and is more than belief, since true faith always moves
                its possessor to some kind of physical and mental action; it carries an assurance of the fulfillment of
                the things hoped for. A lack of faith leads one to despair, which comes because of iniquity.</p>

              <p>Although faith is a gift, it must be cultured and sought after until it grows from a tiny seed to a
                great tree. The effects of true faith in Jesus Christ include (1) an actual knowledge that the course of
                life one is pursuing is acceptable to the Lord (see Heb. 11:4); (2) a reception of the blessings of the
                Lord that are available to man in this life; and (3) an assurance of personal salvation in the world to
                come. These things involve individual and personal testimony, guidance, revelation, and spiritual
                knowledge. Where there is true faith there are miracles, visions, dreams, healings, and all the gifts of
                God that He gives to His saints. Jesus pointed out some obstacles to faith in John 5:44 and 12:39–42
                (see also James 1:6–8).</p>

              <p>6 I say unto you, if ye have come to a knowledge of the goodness of God, and his matchless power, and
                his wisdom, and his patience, and his long-suffering towards the children of men; and also, the
                atonement which has been prepared from the foundation of the world, that thereby salvation might come to
                him that should put his trust in the Lord, and should be diligent in keeping his commandments, and
                continue in the faith even unto the end of his life, I mean the life of the mortal body—</p>

              <p>7 I say, that this is the man who receiveth salvation, through the atonement which was prepared from
                the foundation of the world for all mankind, which ever were since the fall of Adam, or who are, or who
                ever shall be, even unto the end of the world.</p>

              <p>8 And this is the means whereby salvation cometh. And there is none other salvation save this which
                hath been spoken of; neither are there any conditions whereby man can be saved except the conditions
                which I have told you.</p>

              <p>9 Believe in God; believe that he is, and that he created all things, both in heaven and in earth;
                believe that he has all wisdom, and all power, both in heaven and in earth; believe that man doth not
                comprehend all the things which the Lord can comprehend.</p>

              <p>10 And again, believe that ye must repent of your sins and forsake them, and humble yourselves before
                God; and ask in sincerity of heart that he would forgive you; and now, if you believe all these things
                see that ye do them.</p>

              <p>11 And again I say unto you as I have said before, that as ye have come to the knowledge of the glory
                of God, or if ye have known of his goodness and have tasted of his love, and have received a remission
                of your sins, which causeth such exceedingly great joy in your souls, even so I would that ye should
                remember, and always retain in remembrance, the greatness of God, and your own nothingness, and his
                goodness and long-suffering towards you, unworthy creatures, and humble yourselves even in the depths of
                humility, calling on the name of the Lord daily, and standing steadfastly in the faith of that which is
                to come, which was spoken by the mouth of the angel.</p>

              <p>12 And behold, I say unto you that if ye do this ye shall always rejoice, and be filled with the love
                of God, and always retain a remission of your sins; and ye shall grow in the knowledge of the glory of
                him that created you, or in the knowledge of that which is just and true.</p>

                  which is true—Alma testifies that angels minister to men, women, and children—Alma compares the word
                  unto a seed—It must be planted and nourished—Then it grows into a tree from which the fruit of eternal
                  life is picked. About 74 B.C.</em></p>
              <p>1 And it came to pass that they did go forth, and began to preach the word of God unto the people,
                entering into their synagogues, and into their houses; yea, and even they did preach the word in their
                streets.</p>
              <p>2 And it came to pass that after much labor among them, they began to have success among the poor class
                of people; for behold, they were cast out of the synagogues because of the coarseness of their apparel—
              </p>
              <p>3 Therefore they were not permitted to enter into their synagogues to worship God, being esteemed as
                filthiness; therefore they were poor; yea, they were esteemed by their brethren as dross; therefore they
                were poor as to things of the world; and also they were poor in heart.</p>
              <p>4 Now, as Alma was teaching and speaking unto the people upon the hill Onidah, there came a great
                multitude unto him, who were those of whom we have been speaking, of whom were poor in heart, because of
                their poverty as to the things of the world.</p>
              <p>5 And they came unto Alma; and the one who was the foremost among them said unto him: Behold, what
                shall these my brethren do, for they are despised of all men because of their poverty, yea, and more
                especially by our priests; for they have cast us out of our synagogues which we have labored abundantly
                to build with our own hands; and they have cast us out because of our exceeding poverty; and we have no
                place to worship our God; and behold, what shall we do?</p>
              <p>6 And now when Alma heard this, he turned him about, his face immediately towards him, and he beheld
                with great joy; for he beheld that their afflictions had truly humbled them, and that they were in a
                preparation to hear the word.</p>
              <p>7 Therefore he did say no more to the other multitude; but he stretched forth his hand, and cried unto
                those whom he beheld, who were truly penitent, and said unto them:</p>
              <p>8 I behold that ye are lowly in heart; and if so, blessed are ye.</p>
              <p>9 Behold thy brother hath said, What shall we do?—for we are cast out of our synagogues, that we cannot
                worship our God.</p>
              <p>10 Behold I say unto you, do ye suppose that ye cannot worship God save it be in your synagogues only?
              </p>
              <p>11 And moreover, I would ask, do ye suppose that ye must not worship God only once in a week?</p>
              <p>12 I say unto you, it is well that ye are cast out of your synagogues, that ye may be humble, and that
                ye may learn wisdom; for it is necessary that ye should learn wisdom; for it is because that ye are cast
                out, that ye are despised of your brethren because of your exceeding poverty, that ye are brought to a
                lowliness of heart; for ye are necessarily brought to be humble.</p>
              <p>13 And now, because ye are compelled to be humble blessed are ye; for a man sometimes, if he is
                compelled to be humble, seeketh repentance; and now surely, whosoever repenteth shall find mercy; and he
                that findeth mercy and endureth to the end the same shall be saved.</p>
              <p>14 And now, as I said unto you, that because ye were compelled to be humble ye were blessed, do ye not
                suppose that they are more blessed who truly humble themselves because of the word?</p>
              <p>15 Yea, he that truly humbleth himself, and repenteth of his sins, and endureth to the end, the same
                shall be blessed—yea, much more blessed than they who are compelled to be humble because of their
                exceeding poverty.</p>
              <p>16 Therefore, blessed are they who humble themselves without being compelled to be humble; or rather,
                in other words, blessed is he that believeth in the word of God, and is baptized without stubbornness of
                heart, yea, without being brought to know the word, or even compelled to know, before they will believe.
              </p>
              <p>17 Yea, there are many who do say: If thou wilt show unto us a sign from heaven, then we shall know of
                a surety; then we shall believe.</p>
              <p>18 Now I ask, is this faith? Behold, I say unto you, Nay; for if a man knoweth a thing he hath no cause
                to believe, for he knoweth it.</p>
              <p>19 And now, how much more cursed is he that knoweth the will of God and doeth it not, than he that only
                believeth, or only hath cause to believe, and falleth into transgression?</p>
              <p>20 Now of this thing ye must judge. Behold, I say unto you, that it is on the one hand even as it is on
                the other; and it shall be unto every man according to his work.</p>
              <p>21 And now as I said concerning faith—faith is not to have a perfect knowledge of things; therefore if
                ye have faith ye hope for things which are not seen, which are true.</p>
              <p>22 And now, behold, I say unto you, and I would that ye should remember, that God is merciful unto all
                who believe on his name; therefore he desireth, in the first place, that ye should believe, yea, even on
                his word.</p>
              <p>23 And now, he imparteth his word by angels unto men, yea, not only men but women also. Now this is not
                all; little children do have words given unto them many times, which confound the wise and the learned.
              </p>
              <p>24 And now, my beloved brethren, as ye have desired to know of me what ye shall do because ye are
                afflicted and cast out—now I do not desire that ye should suppose that I mean to judge you only
                according to that which is true—</p>
              <p>25 For I do not mean that ye all of you have been compelled to humble yourselves; for I verily believe
                that there are some among you who would humble themselves, let them be in whatsoever circumstances they
                might.</p>
              <p>26 Now, as I said concerning faith—that it was not a perfect knowledge—even so it is with my words. Ye
                cannot know of their surety at first, unto perfection, any more than faith is a perfect knowledge.</p>
              <p>27 But behold, if ye will awake and arouse your faculties, even to an experiment upon my words, and
                exercise a particle of faith, yea, even if ye can no more than desire to believe, let this desire work
                in you, even until ye believe in a manner that ye can give place for a portion of my words.</p>
              <p>28 Now, we will compare the word unto a seed. Now, if ye give place, that a seed may be planted in your
                heart, behold, if it be a true seed, or a good seed, if ye do not cast it out by your unbelief, that ye
                will resist the Spirit of the Lord, behold, it will begin to swell within your breasts; and when you
                feel these swelling motions, ye will begin to say within yourselves—It must needs be that this is a good
                seed, or that the word is good, for it beginneth to enlarge my soul; yea, it beginneth to enlighten my
                understanding, yea, it beginneth to be delicious to me.</p>
              <p>29 Now behold, would not this increase your faith? I say unto you, Yea; nevertheless it hath not grown
                up to a perfect knowledge.</p>
              <p>30 But behold, as the seed swelleth, and sprouteth, and beginneth to grow, then you must needs say that
                the seed is good; for behold it swelleth, and sprouteth, and beginneth to grow. And now, behold, will
                not this strengthen your faith? Yea, it will strengthen your faith: for ye will say I know that this is
                a good seed; for behold it sprouteth and beginneth to grow.</p>
              <p>31 And now, behold, are ye sure that this is a good seed? I say unto you, Yea; for every seed bringeth
                forth unto its own likeness.</p>
              <p>32 Therefore, if a seed groweth it is good, but if it groweth not, behold it is not good, therefore it
                is cast away.</p>
              <p>33 And now, behold, because ye have tried the experiment, and planted the seed, and it swelleth and
                sprouteth, and beginneth to grow, ye must needs know that the seed is good.</p>
              <p>34 And now, behold, is your knowledge perfect? Yea, your knowledge is perfect in that thing, and your
                faith is dormant; and this because you know, for ye know that the word hath swelled your souls, and ye
                also know that it hath sprouted up, that your understanding doth begin to be enlightened, and your mind
                doth begin to expand.</p>
              <p>35 O then, is not this real? I say unto you, Yea, because it is light; and whatsoever is light, is
                good, because it is discernible, therefore ye must know that it is good; and now behold, after ye have
                tasted this light is your knowledge perfect?</p>
              <p>36 Behold I say unto you, Nay; neither must ye lay aside your faith, for ye have only exercised your
                faith to plant the seed that ye might try the experiment to know if the seed was good.</p>
              <p>37 And behold, as the tree beginneth to grow, ye will say: Let us nourish it with great care, that it
                may get root, that it may grow up, and bring forth fruit unto us. And now behold, if ye nourish it with
                much care it will get root, and grow up, and bring forth fruit.</p>
              <p>38 But if ye neglect the tree, and take no thought for its nourishment, behold it will not get any
                root; and when the heat of the sun cometh and scorcheth it, because it hath no root it withers away, and
                ye pluck it up and cast it out.</p>
              <p>39 Now, this is not because the seed was not good, neither is it because the fruit thereof would not be
                desirable; but it is because your ground is barren, and ye will not nourish the tree, therefore ye
                cannot have the fruit thereof.</p>
              <p>40 And thus, if ye will not nourish the word, looking forward with an eye of faith to the fruit
                thereof, ye can never pluck of the fruit of the tree of life.</p>
              <p>41 But if ye will nourish the word, yea, nourish the tree as it beginneth to grow, by your faith with
                great diligence, and with patience, looking forward to the fruit thereof, it shall take root; and behold
                it shall be a tree springing up unto everlasting life.</p>
              <p>42 And because of your diligence and your faith and your patience with the word in nourishing it, that
                it may take root in you, behold, by and by ye shall pluck the fruit thereof, which is most precious,
                which is sweet above all that is sweet, and which is white above all that is white, yea, and pure above
                all that is pure; and ye shall feast upon this fruit even until ye are filled, that ye hunger not,
                neither shall ye thirst.</p>
              <p>43 Then, my brethren, ye shall reap the rewards of your faith, and your diligence, and patience, and
                long-suffering, waiting for the tree to bring forth fruit unto you.</p>

              <p>7 For it was by faith that Christ showed himself unto our fathers, after he had risen from the dead;
                and he showed not himself unto them until after they had faith in him; wherefore, it must needs be that
                some had faith in him, for he showed himself not unto the world.</p>

              <p>8 But because of the faith of men he has shown himself unto the world, and glorified the name of the
                Father, and prepared a way that thereby others might be partakers of the heavenly gift, that they might
                hope for those things which they have not seen.</p>

              <p>9 Wherefore, ye may also have hope, and be partakers of the gift, if ye will but have faith.</p>

              <p>10 Behold it was by faith that they of old were called after the holy order of God.</p>

              <p>11 Wherefore, by faith was the law of Moses given. But in the gift of his Son hath God prepared a more
                excellent way; and it is by faith that it hath been fulfilled.</p>

              <p>12 For if there be no faith among the children of men God can do no miracle among them; wherefore, he
                showed not himself until after their faith.</p>

              <p>13 Behold, it was the faith of Alma and Amulek that caused the prison to tumble to the earth.</p>

              <p>14 Behold, it was the faith of Nephi and Lehi that wrought the change upon the Lamanites, that they
                were baptized with fire and with the Holy Ghost.</p>

              <p>15 Behold, it was the faith of Ammon and his brethren which wrought so great a miracle among the
                Lamanites.</p>

              <p>16 Yea, and even all they who wrought miracles wrought them by faith, even those who were before Christ
                and also those who were after.</p>

              <p>17 And it was by faith that the three disciples obtained a promise that they should not taste of death;
                and they obtained not the promise until after their faith.</p>

              <p>18 And neither at any time hath any wrought miracles until after their faith; wherefore they first
                believed in the Son of God.</p>

              <p>19 And there were many whose faith was so exceedingly strong, even before Christ came, who could not be
                kept from within the veil, but truly saw with their eyes the things which they had beheld with an eye of
                faith, and they were glad.</p>

              <p>20 And behold, we have seen in this record that one of these was the brother of Jared; for so great was
                his faith in God, that when God put forth his finger he could not hide it from the sight of the brother
                of Jared, because of his word which he had spoken unto him, which word he had obtained by faith.</p>

              <p>21 And after the brother of Jared had beheld the finger of the Lord, because of the promise which the
                brother of Jared had obtained by faith, the Lord could not withhold anything from his sight; wherefore
                he showed him all things, for he could no longer be kept without the veil.</p>

              <p>22 And it is by faith that my fathers have obtained the promise that these things should come unto
                their brethren through the Gentiles; therefore the Lord hath commanded me, yea, even Jesus Christ.</p>

              <p>Chapter 11</p>

              <p><em>By faith we understand the word and work of God—The faith of the ancients was centered in Christ—By
                  faith, men subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, and worked miracles.</em></p>

              <p>1 Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.</p>

              <p>2 For by it the elders obtained a good report.</p>

              <p>3 Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are
                seen were not made of things which do appear.</p>

              <p>4 By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness
                that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh.</p>

              <p>5 By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had
                translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.</p>

              <p>6 But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is,
                and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.</p>

              <p>7 By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the
                saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is
                by faith.</p>

              <p>8 By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an
                inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went.</p>

              <p>9 By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with
                Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:</p>

              <p>10 For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God.</p>

              <p>11 Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child
                when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised.</p>

              <p>12 Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, so many as the stars of the sky in
                multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable.</p>

              <p>13 These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were
                persuaded of them, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.
              </p>

              <p>14 For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country.</p>

              <p>15 And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they might have had
                opportunity to have returned.</p>

              <p>16 But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be
                called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city.</p>

              <p>17 By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered
                up his only begotten son,</p>

              <p>18 Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called:</p>

              <p>19 Accounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead; from whence also he received him
                in a figure.</p>

              <p>20 By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.</p>

              <p>21 By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph; and worshipped, leaning upon
                the top of his staff.</p>

              <p>22 By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the children of Israel; and gave
                commandment concerning his bones.</p>

              <p>23 By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw he was a
                proper child; and they were not afraid of the king’s commandment.</p>

              <p>24 By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter;</p>

              <p>25 Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for
                a season;</p>

              <p>26 Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto
                the recompence of the reward.</p>

              <p>27 By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is
                invisible.</p>

              <p>28 Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the
                firstborn should touch them.</p>

              <p>29 By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land: which the Egyptians assaying to do were
                drowned.</p>

              <p>30 By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were compassed about seven days.</p>

              <p>31 By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, when she had received the spies
                with peace.</p>

              <p>32 And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and of Barak, and of
                Samson, and of Jephthae; of David also, and Samuel, and of the prophets:</p>

              <p>33 Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of
                lions,</p>

              <p>34 Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong,
                waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.</p>

              <p>35 Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance;
                that they might obtain a better resurrection:</p>

              <p>36 And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment:</p>

              <p>37 They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered
                about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;</p>

              <p>38 (Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and
                caves of the earth.</p>

              <p>39 And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise:</p>

              <p>40 God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.</p>

              <p>1 And now, it came to pass that when king Benjamin had thus spoken to his people, he sent among them,
                desiring to know of his people if they believed the words which he had spoken unto them.</p>

              <p>2 And they all cried with one voice, saying: Yea, we believe all the words which thou hast spoken unto
                us; and also, we know of their surety and truth, because of the Spirit of the Lord Omnipotent, which has
                wrought a mighty change in us, or in our hearts, that we have no more disposition to do evil, but to do
                good continually.</p>

              <p>3 And we, ourselves, also, through the infinite goodness of God, and the manifestations of his Spirit,
                have great views of that which is to come; and were it expedient, we could prophesy of all things.</p>

              <p>4 And it is the faith which we have had on the things which our king has spoken unto us that has
                brought us to this great knowledge, whereby we do rejoice with such exceedingly great joy.</p>

              <p>5 And we are willing to enter into a covenant with our God to do his will, and to be obedient to his
                commandments in all things that he shall command us, all the remainder of our days, that we may not
                bring upon ourselves a never-ending torment, as has been spoken by the angel, that we may not drink out
                of the cup of the wrath of God.</p>

              <p>6 And now, these are the words which king Benjamin desired of them; and therefore he said unto them: Ye
                have spoken the words that I desired; and the covenant which ye have made is a righteous covenant.</p>

              <p>7 And now, because of the covenant which ye have made ye shall be called the children of Christ, his
                sons, and his daughters; for behold, this day he hath spiritually begotten you; for ye say that your
                hearts are changed through faith on his name; therefore, ye are born of him and have become his sons and
                his daughters.</p>

              <p>8 And under this head ye are made free, and there is no other head whereby ye can be made free. There
                is no other name given whereby salvation cometh; therefore, I would that ye should take upon you the
                name of Christ, all you that have entered into the covenant with God that ye should be obedient unto the
                end of your lives.</p>

              <p>9 And it shall come to pass that whosoever doeth this shall be found at the right hand of God, for he
                shall know the name by which he is called; for he shall be called by the name of Christ.</p>

              <p>10 And now it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall not take upon him the name of Christ must be
                called by some other name; therefore, he findeth himself on the left hand of God.</p>

              <p>11 And I would that ye should remember also, that this is the name that I said I should give unto you
                that never should be blotted out, except it be through transgression; therefore, take heed that ye do
                not transgress, that the name be not blotted out of your hearts.</p>

              <p>12 I say unto you, I would that ye should remember to retain the name written always in your hearts,
                that ye are not found on the left hand of God, but that ye hear and know the voice by which ye shall be
                called, and also, the name by which he shall call you.</p>

              <p>13 For how knoweth a man the master whom he has not served, and who is a stranger unto him, and is far
                from the thoughts and intents of his heart?</p>

              <p>14 And again, doth a man take an ass which belongeth to his neighbor, and keep him? I say unto you,
                Nay; he will not even suffer that he shall feed among his flocks, but will drive him away, and cast him
                out. I say unto you, that even so shall it be among you if ye know not the name by which ye are called.
              </p>

              <p>15 Therefore, I would that ye should be steadfast and immovable, always abounding in good works, that
                Christ, the Lord God Omnipotent, may seal you his, that you may be brought to heaven, that ye may have
                everlasting salvation and eternal life, through the wisdom, and power, and justice, and mercy of him who
                created all things, in heaven and in earth, who is God above all. Amen.</p>

              <p>9 O remember, remember, my sons, the words which king Benjamin spake unto his people; yea, remember

                Christ, who shall come; yea, remember that he cometh to redeem the world.</p>

              <p>10 And remember also the words which Amulek spake unto Zeezrom, in the city of Ammonihah; for he said
                unto him that the Lord surely should come to redeem his people, but that he should not come to redeem
                them in their sins, but to redeem them from their sins.</p>

              <p>11 And he hath power given unto him from the Father to redeem them from their sins because of
                repentance; therefore he hath sent his angels to declare the tidings of the conditions of repentance,
                which bringeth unto the power of the Redeemer, unto the salvation of their souls.</p>

              <p>12 And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the
                Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds,
                yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it
                shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock
                upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall.
